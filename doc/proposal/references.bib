    abstract = {English. In this paper we describe the system used for the participation to the {ABSITA}, {GxG}, {HaSpeeDe} and {IronITA} shared tasks of the {EVALITA} 2018 conference. We developed a classiﬁer that can be conﬁgured to use Bidirectional Long Short Term Memories and linear Support Vector Machines as learning algorithms. When using Bi-{LSTMs} we tested a multitask learning approach which learns the optimized parameters of the network exploiting simultaneously all the annotated dataset labels and a multiclassiﬁer voting approach based on a k-fold technique. In addition, we developed generic and speciﬁc word embedding lexicons to further improve classiﬁcation performances. When evaluated on the ofﬁcial test sets, our system ranked 1st in almost all subtasks for each shared task, showing the effectiveness of our approach.},
